# Supernatural-Inheritance
There are three ranks of magicians. They rank from least to most powerful: Pupils, Mages, and Archmages. In this project youâ€™ll be developing a system in C# to track the weather magicians in the guild and their spells.  Pupils have a title and can create one weak wind storm. Mages have a title and can create a weak wind storm and a weak rain storm. Archmages have a title and can create a weak wind storm, a strong rain storm, and a strong lightning storm.
